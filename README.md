# easyA
## Overview
A small suite of dev tools designed to enable easier Amazon Alexa development. This is designed to be run in a programmers development environment with testing taking place through AWS Lambda.
## Prerequisites
You must already have `python3` and python `virtualenv` installed. For full functionality, you will also need to be able to run this code from within a `bash` shell (meaning that none of this has been tested on Windows, but you're more than welcome to be the first to try it). You will also need your own AWS account.
## Setup
Coming soon.


### Notes to self
None of the tutorials I've found mention building the skill. Do that. It is
necessary.
